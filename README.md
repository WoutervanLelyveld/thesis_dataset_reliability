# MSc Thesis Dataset Reliability

## Master Information Studies: Information Systems track

### Predicting dataset reliability through Kaggle Datasets.

This repository contains the following:

> The Exploratory Data Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb), containing the code to retrieve the Meta Kaggle dataset for this research. This file also develops the variables needed to run the other notebooks.

> The Pair Plots (pair_plots.ipynb) for plotting the correlation between different columns in the Meta Kaggle dataset.

> The Machine Learning models used in this research, divided in four directories. Consisting of a Linear Regression, Deep Neural Network, XGboost and a test run for the LightGBM model. The LightGBM is in the end not used for this research. The validation loss of all the models are also included.

> The XGBoost also includes the plots that represent the contribution of each feature to the model by using SHAP.

> The UsabilityRating from Kaggle can be retrieved with the Retrieve Usability Rating notebook. This is a experimental piece that was used for trying to retrieve the UsabilityRating from each dataset as this is not provided by the Kaggle API.
